### Profile

Here you can add your **name, bio,** and **profile picture.** Your profile represents an Object in your Anytype Graph which you can freely link to other Objects.

### Appearance

**Set color mode:** Choose between light, dark or system color modes.

**Automatically show and hide sidebar:** With this option disabled the sidebar won't automatically pop out when you hover over the left side of the screen.

**Show Anytype in system tray:** Anytype will always stay running in the background, but you have the option to either have it show in the system tray or not.

**Display relative dates:** You can decide whether you want relative dates like today / tomorrow to be used, or whether you want all dates to show the exact date.

**Show menu bar:** This setting will show the default menu bar for your OS.

### Pin Code

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is currently available only on desktop.
{% endhint %}

If you want more privacy, like when sharing a computer, you can set up a PIN code. This will lock the app and keep your Key safe. You'll just need to enter the PIN each time your Anytype session ends (after 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 1 hour) or when you need to access your Key.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We do not store this data, so we cannot help you in recovering your vault in the case it is lost. Make sure to write down your pin code next to your Key.
{% endhint %}

### Spaces

You can also manage all of your spaces by going into `Settings > Spaces`.

### Data Management

**Local Files:** You can choose to offload files stored in Anytype to our Encrypted Backup Node.

**Data Location:** You can also decide where your data is stored (desktop only).

**Vault Deletion:** Also, if you would like to delete your vault, you can do it in this section.

### Key

You can access your Key or scan the QR code to connect your mobile device. For more details, please check [what-is-a-recovery-phrase.md](../../data-and-security/what-is-a-recovery-phrase.md "mention").
