# Collections

Collections can be used to organize a variety of different objects and store them in one place.

You are not restricted to viewing only one Object Type at a time, this means you can have multiple different types within one collection.&#x20;

### Example

If you are organizing your meal prep for the week, you might have a list of recipes, as well as ingredients and a shopping list.&#x20;

The main types you may have could be Recipes and Ingredients.&#x20;

In a Collection, you can organize all of these Types together seamlessly.&#x20;
